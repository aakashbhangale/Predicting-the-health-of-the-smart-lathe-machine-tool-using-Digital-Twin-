# Predicting the health of the smart lathe machine tool using Digital Twin 

**1> Purpose of the project**<br>
Demonstrate that manual machining equipment such as the Lathe machine can be converted into the system with smart unified connectivity components, for real-time data monitoring and anomaly detection. 


**2> Methodology**<br> 
The sequence to build this project is divided into 5 segments: <br>
	--> Design and Simulation 
	--> Sensor integration 
	--> IIoT Implementation 
	--> Real-time Dashboard (and immersive visualization) 
	--> Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction 

**3> Features of the project prototype** <br> 
•	Brings the virtual world to reality using AR/VR 
•	Real-time Smart Lathe Parameter monitoring 
•	Tool Health and RUL Prediction 

**4> Monitored Parameters** <br>

**Flow of the project** <br>
A vibration sensor and a thermocouple are used to measure data relating to vibrations and temperature at the tool-workpiece interaction, respectively. These sensor data are collected inside the microcontroller.

That data is then monitored on the Blynk IoT Cloud Platform called Blynk Console and displayed using the Blynk IoT Application, Blynk Console Web Application, and the Smart Lathe BVM AR Application built from scratch for Android smartphones.
