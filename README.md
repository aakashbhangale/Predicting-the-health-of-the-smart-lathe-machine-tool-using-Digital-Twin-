# Predicting the health of the smart lathe machine tool using Digital Twin 

1> **Purpose of the project** \n Demonstrate that manual machining equipment such as the Lathe machine can be converted into the system with smart unified connectivity components, for real-time data monitoring and anomaly detection. 


2> **Methodology** \n 
The sequence to build this project is divided into 5 segments: 
	--> Design and Simulation 
	--> Sensor integration 
	--> IIoT Implementation 
	--> Real-time Dashboard (and immersive visualization) 
	--> Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction 

3> **Features of the project prototype** \n 
•	Brings the virtual world to reality using AR/VR 
•	Real-time Smart Lathe Parameter monitoring 
•	Tool Health and RUL Prediction
