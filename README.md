# Predicting the health of the smart lathe machine tool using Digital Twin 

**1> Purpose of the project**<br>
Demonstrate that manual machining equipment such as the Lathe machine can be converted into the system with smart unified connectivity components, for real-time data monitoring and anomaly detection. 


**2> Methodology**<br> 
The sequence to build this project is divided into 5 segments: <br>
	--> Design and Simulation 
	--> Sensor integration 
	--> IIoT Implementation 
	--> Real-time Dashboard (and immersive visualization) 
	--> Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction 

**3> Features of the project prototype** <br> 
•	Brings the virtual world to reality using AR/VR 
•	Real-time Smart Lathe Parameter monitoring 
•	Tool Health and RUL Prediction 

**4> Monitored Parameters!** <br>
